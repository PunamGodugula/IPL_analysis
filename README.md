IPL Cricket Analysis
This repository contains Python code and analysis conducted on IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket data. The analysis focuses on exploring batting and bowling performance, extras distribution, team-specific analysis, player performance, and match context analysis.

Dataset
The dataset used for analysis contains detailed ball-by-ball and matches information from IPL matches from 2008-2022 including innings data, batting and bowling details, wicket-taking patterns, extras information, and more.

Analysis Overview
Overall Batting Performance
Calculated basic batting statistics such as total runs scored, average runs per innings, and strike rate.
Visualized the distribution of runs scored using histograms.
Bowling Performance
Analyzed bowling statistics such as total wickets taken and bowling average.
Extras Analysis
Calculated the distribution of different types of extras (e.g., wides, no-balls) and their frequency.
Visualized the distribution of extras using bar plots.
Team-Specific Analysis
Examined batting statistics for each team, including total runs scored and average runs per innings.
Player Performance Analysis
Identified top-performing batsmen and bowlers based on total runs scored and wickets taken, respectively.
Match Context Analysis
Explored the total runs scored by each batting team to understand match outcomes.
